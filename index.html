    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <br />
      <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
     <p> The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and
      you must choose one of these. After you make your<br>choice you will get a
      new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what
      choice you made. This procedure is<br>repeated over and over until you
      reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final
      state is a goal state; if<br>you didn't, it isn't.</p>
      
      <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has
        some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that<br>the leaves
        are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node,
        beginning with the root, you choose one of its<br>children to move to, and
        you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p>
      <p>
        Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to
      continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice,<br>
      and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of
      options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try<br>another choice at
      that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no
      good leaves to be found.
      </p>
      <p>This needs an example.</p>
      <img src="./img/root.jpg" alt="" width="400px" />
      <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li><br>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li><br>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li><br>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li><br>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li><br>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li><br>
      </ol>
      <p>
       <strong> In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract
        model of the possible sequences of choices we could<br>make. There is also
        a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data
        structure to tell us what choices we<br>have. (If we do have an actual tree
        data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree
        searching.)</strong>

    <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
    <br />
      <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
       <pre>
        boolean solve(Node n) { 
          if n is a leaf node {
             if the leaf is a goal node, return true
             else return false
           } else {
              for each child c of n {
                 if solve(c) succeeds, return true
               }
              return false
             } 
          }
       </pre>  
      </font>
      <p>
       <strong> Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is
        essential to understanding the algorithm. If<br>solve(n) is true, that
        means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes
        on a path from the root to<br>some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If
        solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal
        node.</strong>
      </p><br>
    <p><b>How does this work?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path
        to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any<br>child of n is
        solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above
        code, this is done by the lines
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
     <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
      <pre>
        for each child c of n {
             if solve(c) succeeds, return true
             }
             return false
        </pre>
     </font>
      <p>
        Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf
        node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal<br>
        node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this
        is done by the lines
      </p>
     <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
      <pre>

        if n is a leaf node {
           if the leaf is a goal node, return true
           else return false
           }</pre>
     </font>
     <br>
      <p>
        The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should
        understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul><br>
        <li><h3>To search a tree:</h3></li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li><br>
        <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have<br>searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
      </ol>
    </div><br>
      <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
      <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact,<br>that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.</p><br>
      <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
        <pre>

          boolean solve(Node n) {
            put node n on the stack;
             while the stack is not empty {
              if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
                 if it is a goal node, return true
                  else pop it off the stack
              }
               else {
                 if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                     push the next untried child onto the stack
                 else pop the node off the stack
              
              }
             return false
             }
        </pre>
      </font>
      <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the<br>stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the<br>tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,<br>if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the <br>problem.
        <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal<br>node.</p>
        <p>Similarly when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node,the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of<br> recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node<br>at the current level, or storing it in an array.</p><br> Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:</p>
      <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
        <pre>

          boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node {
              if the leaf is a goal node {
                 print n
                 return true
               }
                 else return false
             } else {
               for each child c of n {
                  if solve(c) succeeds {
                     print n
                     return true
                  }
                }
                return false
              }
            }
        </pre>
      </font><br>
      <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
      <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty<br>cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:</p>
        
        <p>for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate<br> solutions</p>
        
        <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test<br>whether a node is a leaf by writing a <strong>gameOver method</strong> (or you could even call it <strong>isLeaf).</strong> This method would encapsulate all the<br>ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.</p>

        <p>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have<br>been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying<strong>for each child<br>c of n.</strong> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through<br>them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can<br>represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track<br>of which ones you've already examined?</p>
        
        <p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the<br>node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When<br>the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require<br>quite a lot of additional work.</p>

        <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an<br> ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next.</p>

        <p>For example, you might be able to number the <strong>children 1 through n,</strong> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried<br><strong>child k,</strong> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <strong>k-1,</strong> and you have not yet tried children <strong>k+1</strong> through <strong>n.</strong> Or, if you <br>are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try <strong>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</strong> If child yellow fails,<br>you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right <strong>(or perhaps<br>north, east, south, west).</strong></p>

        <p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <strong>In the chess game example,</strong> you might number your<br>pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each piece may also have several<br> moves, and these must also be ordered.</p><br>
  
      <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
      <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the<br>simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.<br>
        <p>A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point<br>to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child.<br>All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not<br>part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The<br>first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.<br></p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>
     <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
      <pre>
        
        public class BinaryTree {
          BinaryTree leftChild = null;
          BinaryTree rightChild = null;
          boolean isGoalNode = false;
          String name;

         BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
          this.name = name;
          leftChild = left; 
          rightChild = right;
          this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
         }
        }

      </pre>
     </font>
      <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.</p>
     <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
      <pre>
        
        static BinaryTree makeTree() {
          BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
          c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
          d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);
          e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);
          f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);
          a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
          b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);
          root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);
          return root;
        }

      </pre>
     </font>
      <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
     <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
      <pre>

        public static void main(String args[]) {
          BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
          System.out.println(solvable(tree));
        }

      </pre>
     </font>
      <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
      <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem"><pre>

        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {

        /* 1 */ if (node == null) return false;

        /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;

        /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;

        /* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;

        /* 5 */ return false;

        }

      </pre></font>
      <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without<br> first checking whether those children actually exist.</li><br>
        <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li><br>
        <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null<br> and is not a goal node, says to</li><br>
        <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li><br>
        <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li><br>
      </ol>
      <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</p>
      <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An<br> alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:</p>
     <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
      <pre>

        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
          if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
          if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
          if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
          return false;
        }

      </pre>
     </font>
      <p>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>What are the children?</h3>
      <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous<br>choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the<br>right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without<br>recursion.</p>

      <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter<br> how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the<br> same color.</p>
      
      <p>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are<br> colored.</p><p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li><br>
        <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of<br>countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p?>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a<br>checkerboard only needs two colors.</p>
      <p><b><span>boolean mapIsOK()</span></b><br>
        Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.
        <br><br>
        <b><span>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</span></b><br>
        Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.
        <br><br>
        <b><span>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</span></b><br>
        Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard).</p>

        <br>
        <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
       <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
        <pre>

          boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {
            if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return mapIsOK();
            map[row][column] = color;
            for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
              int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
              if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
            }
            return false;
          }
        </pre>
       </font>
        <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>
       <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
        <pre>

          boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) {
            if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return true;
            if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {
              map[row][column] = color;
              for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
                int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
              }
            }
            return false;
          }
        </pre>
       </font>
        <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests otherwise:</p>
        <table border="1" align="center" width="390px">
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td bgcolor="lightgray">2 by 3 map</td>
            <td bgcolor="lightgray">3 by 3 map</td>
            <td bgcolor="lightgray">3 by 4 map</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="lightgray">Method 1:</td>
            <td>60 ms.</td>
            <td>940 ms.</td>
            <td>60530 ms. (1 minute)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td bgcolor="lightgray">Method 2:</td>
            <td>0ms.</td>
            <td>0 ms.</td>
            <td>0 ms</td>
          </tr>
        </table><br>
        <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of<br>these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will<br>often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically<br>guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p>

        <h3 align="left">Debugging techniques</h3>
        <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall<br>back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be<br>applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.</p><br>
        <p><b>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</b><br><br>
         Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably<br>want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long<br>list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</p>
         <br>
         <p><b>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</b><br><br>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself<br>contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.</p>
         <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs<br>the proportions will be better.</p>

            static String indent = "";


            static String name(BinaryTree node) {
              if (node == null) return null;
              else return node.name;
            }


            static void enter(BinaryTree node) { 
              System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
              indent = indent + "| ";
            }


            static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {            
              indent = indent.substring(3);
              System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
              return true;
            }


              static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
                indent = indent.substring(3);
                System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
                return false;
              }
           </pre>
        </font>
         <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
        <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
          <pre>

            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
              enter(node);
              if (node == null) return no(node);
              if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
              if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node);
              if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);
              return no(node);
            }
           </pre>
        </font>
          <p>And we get these results:</p>
         <p>Entering solvable(Root)</p>
          <pre>
| Entering solvable(A)
| | Entering solvable(C)
| | | Entering solvable(null)
| | | solvable(null) returns false
| | | Entering solvable(null)

| Entering solvable(B)
| | Entering solvable(E)
| | solvable(E) returns true
| solvable(B) returns true
solvable(Root) returns true
true
          </pre>
          <p><b>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</b></p>
          <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug<br>the debugging statements as it is to debug the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?<br><br>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to<br> your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example,<br>you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these<br>changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.<br><br>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>
         <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem">
          <pre>

            static final boolean debugging = false;
            static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
              if (debugging) {
                System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
                indent = indent + "| ";
              }
            }
            
            static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
              if (debugging) {
                indent = indent.substring(3);
                System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
              }
              return true;
            }
            
            static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
              if (debugging) {
                indent = indent.substring(3);
                System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
              }
              return false;
            }
          </pre>
         </font>
         <p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about<br>making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the<br>controlled code will be discarded.</p><br>
         <p><b>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</b></p>
         <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message<br> printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions.<br> However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following<br> code</p>
         <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem"><pre><br>
          new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre></font><br>
          <p>will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a<br> print statement.</p><br>
          <font color="#29C5F6" size="4rem"><pre>

You have some number n of black marbles and the same number<br>of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in. Start with<br>the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.</p>

              <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,<br>which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.</p> 
              <p>Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the<br>puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to<br>print out the bad news.</p>
              <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,<br>which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.</p>
              <p>Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board<br> position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node.<br> Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.</p>
              <p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of<br> approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find<br>a different but equally valid approach.</p>
              <p>First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump,<br>it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and<br>check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require<br>having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the<br>board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.</p>
              <p>Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a<br>particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that<br>must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight<br>complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.</p>

              <p><b>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each<br>space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int<br>position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</b></p>

              <ul>
                <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
                <br>
                <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
                <br>
                <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
              </ul><br>

              <p>We write another method <b>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board and a position, make a move from<br>that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board,<br>rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative"<br>rather than "mutative."<br><br>Along with <b>canMove and makeMove,</b> we are using methods <b>puzzleSolved and printBoard</b> with meanings that<br>should be obvious. With these methods, our central backtracking method can be written as follows:</p>

              <p><b>Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last<br>line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its<br>results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get<br>them in the correct order.</b></p>
